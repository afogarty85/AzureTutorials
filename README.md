# Azure Tutorials

This repository links to my website but acts as a catch for people searching GitHub for code examples and help with respect to Azure.


1. [Azure Synapse](http://seekinginference.com/applied_azure/synapse.html) In this demo, we walk through the necessary procedures to:
* Create an Azure Synapse environment
* Write SQL tables to Parquet and dump them into our Data Lake
* Run automated pipeline computations on our Data Lake files with AzureML
* Connect our Data Lake with Azure Data Bricks for Big Data analytics
* Setup Azure DevOps for Synapse version control

2. [Azure Static Web App](http://seekinginference.com/applied_azure/web_app.html) In this demo, we walk through the necessary procedures to:
* Build a static web app
* Secure it to a limited audience
* Setup GitHub actions that build our posts automatically for us.

3. [Azure Machine Learning](http://seekinginference.com/applied_azure/AML.html) In this demo, we walk through the necessary procedures to:
* Instantiate a work and compute space
* Loads a tabular data set for prediction
* Run a single experiment
* Scale a hyperparameter search using multiple VMs with `HyperDrive`
* Deploy a model for inference to the web
* Show how to send new input data and retrieve predictions
